* The build System
** Running CMake
   - You should almost always make a separate build tree outside of the main
     tree. For example, if you have directory 'project' with 'project/src' etc.,
     you should make a directory outside of project called 'project\_build'. You
     should change to the new directory and run CMake there.

        mkdir project\_build
        cd project\_build
        cmake ../project

** Making projects
*** Making an Xcode project
    - Change to your build directory and run:

        cmake -G Xcode ../project

      Your new Xcode project should be in 'project\_build/project.xcodeproj'

*** Making an Eclipse CDT project
    - Change to your build directory and run:

        cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../project

      Your new Eclipse CDT project is stored in 'project\_build/.project'. In
      Eclipse, go to Import -> General -> Existng Projects into Workspace ->
      Select root directory and choose the 'project\_build' directory.
